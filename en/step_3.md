## Make your flower

Make your flower out of paper. Follow this step for a simple flower, but be creative with your own designs and colours!

+ Fold it in half again

+ Fold it in half diagonally to make a triangle shape

+ Draw a curve so that you have a shape that looks like an ice cream

+ Cut along the line you just drew

+ Open it up and you have a flower!

Tip: If you want layers to your flower cut two heart flower bases one a little bigger than the other.  The smaller one will fit inside the bigger one.
