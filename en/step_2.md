## Set up your LED

+ Slot a jumper wire onto the end of the long leg of your LED

+ Slot the resistor into the other end of the same jumper wire

+ Add another jumper wire to the other end of the resistor

+ Take another jumper wire and slot one end onto the short leg of the LED

DIAGRAM

Make sure your Raspberry Pi is switched off for this part.

Look at the pins that are sticing out of the top right of your Raspberry Pi.

+ Take the jumper wire that is connected to the resistor and plug it onto the pin lavelled **3V3** on the diagram.

+ Take the jumper wire that is connected to the short leg of the LED ad plug it into the pin labelled **GND** on the diagram
